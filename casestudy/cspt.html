		<h3>Product Overview:</h3>
		<p>Payment at Table is the fastest way to pay at restaurants, allowing guests to view and pay for their bill whenever is convenient for them - without ever downloading an app. Guests can simply use their mobile phones to tap the phones or scan a QR code on their table to quickly be able to view, pay, and close their bill.<br>
		Payments are processed in seconds and allow guests to use their already set up Google or Apple Pay accounts, or quickly enter their credit card. Payments are passed directly to the restaurant's point of sale and the table and the table is closed, so no extra input is required from wait staff.</p>

	<h6 class="sectionheader">WEB APP ARCHITECTURE</h6>
	<p>The following diagram outlines the mobile architecture</p>
	<ol style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
		<li><p><strong>Get Bill</strong><br>
When the user scans the QR code on the tabte tent or the bill using the mobile app, the OR contains the following key information:<br>
Merchant ID<br>
Store ID<br> 
Table Number<br> 
This information directed to the app server for processing.<br>
The request is then directed to OMNIVORE for that particular location ID. The POS Is contacted and the order information for that table is collected. It is then returned to the device for display to the guest.</p></li>
		
		<li><p><strong>Check Offers and Rewards</strong><br>
The offers engine will be checked to see if there are any applicable offer available for the items they have selected or that particular store. If offers are available, the discount will be made displayed on the bill.
The Rewards engine will be checked to see if the user has any available rewards they can redeem.</p></li>
		
		<li><p><strong>Apply Offers and Reward Discount to Bill</strong><br>
Apply any offers or rewards as discounts to the blll on the POS.</p></li>
		
		<li><p><strong>Got Payment Token</strong><br>
When the guest selects to pay using Google Pay (Android) or Apple Pay (iPhone) on the mobile app, the action triggers a Payment Data Request that is sent from the mobile app to Google and Apple. A token is sent in the response by Google and Apple. This is then used in the next make payment call.</p></li>
		
		<li><p><strong>Make Payment</strong><br>
Once the token has been returned by Google Pay or Apple Pay, it is then sent to the cloud as a payment request. This is then subsequently directed from the app server to the payment processor for capture and settlement with the merchant. Once the payment has been successfulty processed, the payment information is sent to OMNIVORE then directed to the POS. The response is sent back to the mobile device for the next step in the process. The merchant can then see all payments made through their POS, this amount will then be seen as a settlement amount into the Payment Processor Merchant account.</p></li>
		
		<li><p><strong>Close Table</strong><br>
Once the response has been received that the payment has been successfully processed, the table can then be 
closed. The request to close is sent to the POS via OMNIVORE. The success response is then sent back to the device.</p></li>
		
		<li><p><strong>Add Loyalty Points</strong><br>
Loyalty points will be calculated based on dollar amount spent and frequency or visits and added to their accoont.</p></li>
		
		<li><p><strong>Send Push Notification</strong><br>
Once the payment has been successfully processed and the table order closed, a success confirmation screen is presented to the guest. At this point a push notification is sent via our Push Notification service containing the following information:<br>
Amount paid <br>
Payment method used <br>
Loyalty Points Earned <br>
Reward earned (if applicable)<br>
Thanking them for their visit</p></li>
		
		<li><p><strong> Get Payment and Loyalty History </strong><br>
The guest can review their payment and loyalty history at any time:<br>
Order number<br> 
Table Number<br> 
Date and time the order was closed<br>
Wait staff name<br>
Loyalty points earned<br>
Order items<br>
Discounts (Offers and Rewards)<br>
Tip<br>
Tax<br>
Total<br>
Payment method </p></li>

	<h6 class="sectionheader">SOLUTION</h6>
		<p style="width: 60%; margin: 0; display: inline-block;">Through learning about the problems we needed to solve and the users we were trying to 
reach we build a design approached that would streamline the user expererience when paying at the restaurant.<br>
Our main goal was to enable the user to see their bill and be able to pay on the spot through the browser by scanning the QR code on the table, knowing this we stripped down the UI to the most basic yet important elements for a user paying a bill.<br>
	User information<br>
	Total<br>
	Tip<br>
	Bill history<br>
	Payment methods<br>
	Receipt<br><br>
	Having identified the first pan of the User Experience we then moved into one of the biggest needs and core of the feature "Split BIii" between the guests.
	The solution I designed for this scenario is a real-time based feature that allows several user on your table to be added on the same bill, each user is able to see in real-time who has been updates on the payment process submitted by each of the user until the is closed in the POS.
