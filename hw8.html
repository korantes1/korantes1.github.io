		Some of the core differences between XSLT 1.0, XPath 1.0 and XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0 are improvements over structuring the syntax and simplifying stylesheets. XSLT 1.0 has many functions that are difficult to process e.g. Grouping, that XSLT 2.0 is making easier by a more sophisticated set of built-in functions and value handling.<br>
		Some differences in XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 can be divided in the primary goals XSLT 2.0 outlined as improvements over XSLT 1.0:
		</p>
		<p>
		Improve ease of use: by simplifying the syntax that forms a stylesheet e.g. 2.0 adds the stylesheet within the &lt;html&gt; tag while 1.0 sets it as &lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt; and you need to define &lt;xsl:output&gt; and &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt; before the &lt;html&gt; tag.<br>
		Support multiple output documents: in XSLT 1.0 when the style sheet is processed only one output document is produced. In XSLT 2.0 you can produce multiple output documents from a single run of the processor.<br>
		Enable the creation of user-defined functions. <br>
		Support the use of XML Schema. <br>
		Simplify content grouping, using &lt;xsl:for-each-group&gt; you can easy handle groups of nodes with common values.<br>
		</p>
		<p>	
		Some of the improvements in XPath 2.0 are that every value is a sequence, Atomic value = one-element sequence. XPath 2.0 has more expressive power, you can put conditional expressions, it supports loops and variables and you can change element's organization.<br>
		Some of the key differences are:<br>
		XPath 2.0. Sequence: XPath 1.0 is not a strongly typed language. Expression in XPath 1.0 return only one of four types: node sets, strings, numbers, and boolean values. XPath is a strongly typed language, and expressions can return many more types. To support this 2.0 returns a sequence, a sequence is a list of items separated by a comma, these items can be node or atomic value and even duplicated items.<br>
		Averaging values, finding min or max values, formatting strings, testing conditions, looping over sequences, writing comments, and more. I think XPath 2.0 introduces a more robust set of instructions that allows us to target elements in XML and have a more structured data and logic that validates this data.
