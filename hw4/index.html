		<h1>PWA &#40;Progressive Web Application&#41; </h1>
		<p>
			A progressive web app (PWA) is the set of mobile web application development techniques that entails building apps that feel and look like native ones. Using a web stack (JS, HTML, and CSS), progressive web apps combine a rich functionality and smooth user experience associated with native apps.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>Some of PWA characteristics are:</span><br> 
			Full responsiveness and browser compatibility, these apps are built according to progressive principles, this is a web design strategy to providing the basic functionality and content to everyone regardless of browser or connection quality.<br>
			Connectivity independence.<br>
			App-like interface.<br>
			Self-Updating.<br>
			Easy installation.<br>
		</p>
		<p> <span>PWA are implemented with the following technical components:</span><br>
			The Web App manifest, a JSON file, gives the native app interface appearance.<br>
			Service Worker, sets offline work mode, background syncs, and push notifications.<br>
			It is typically a JavaScript file running separately from the web page/app.<br>
			The application shell architecture, the core shell consists of core design elements required to make the app run without connection.<br>
		</p>
		<p>PWA is a great solution to convert websites to mobile apps without having to depend on native technoligies. It has a lot of reach as it can impact already built websites and it is cheaper to build than a native app.</p>
